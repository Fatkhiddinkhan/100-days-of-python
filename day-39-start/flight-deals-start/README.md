### Day 39: Overcoming Challenges with the Amadeus Flight API & Building a Flight Deal App ✈️📊

Today marks **Day 39** of my **100 Days of Python** journey, and it was an incredibly challenging yet rewarding day. Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished:

- **Developed a Flight Deal App** 🛫💼
  - **Functionality:**
    - **CSV Integration:** Utilized the Sheety API to access and edit a CSV file stored in Google Sheets.
    - **City & IATA Code Handling:** The app reads city names from the CSV and searches for their corresponding IATA codes. If an IATA code is missing, it automatically searches and fills the empty fields.
    - **Price Comparison:** Compares the current flight prices with those in the CSV file.
    - **Automated Notifications:** Uses the Twilio API to send SMS alerts when flight prices drop by 5% or more.
  
- **Navigated Complex API Documentation** 📚🔍
  - **Amadeus Flight Ticket API:** Tackled the outdated and JavaScript-centric documentation of the Amadeus API. Despite the slow web service and limited resources, I successfully integrated it into my project.
  - **Tutor Assistance:** Leveraged hints and guidance from my tutors to overcome the documentation hurdles and complete the project.

- **Discovered Areas for Improvement** 🧠✨
  - **Weak Points Identified:** Realized the need to strengthen my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills to handle complex projects more efficiently in the future.
  - **Future Plans:** Committed to enhancing my OOP knowledge to reduce difficulties and improve code quality moving forward.

- **Embraced Independent Learning** 💪📈
  - **No Help Videos:** Today was a self-driven day without relying on tutorial videos. I relied on documentation, hints, and resources to guide me through the challenges.

### Reflections & Takeaways

Today was a tough day with a huge amount of data handling and integrating with older API services. Spending two days on this task was stressful, but not giving up allowed me to complete the project successfully. This experience highlighted the importance of perseverance and seeking help when needed. Moving forward, I’m excited to work on strengthening my OOP skills to tackle future challenges with more confidence.

Feeling proud of overcoming today’s hurdles and more motivated than ever to continue this journey! 🚀🐍

Can't wait to see what **Day 40** brings! 🌟

Stay tuned for more updates on this amazing journey! ✨
