### Day 35: Exploring API Keys & Automating Weather Announcements ☔️🔑

Today marks **Day 35** of my **100 Days of Python** journey, and I’m thrilled with the progress I’ve made! Even though it was the weekend, I couldn't resist dedicating more time to my Python learning because it's so interesting and exciting. Here’s what I accomplished:

- **Deep Dive into APIs & API Keys** 🔍🔑
  - **Understanding API Keys:** Learned why API keys are essential for accessing and securing API endpoints.
  - **Purpose of API Keys:** Discovered how they help in authenticating requests and managing usage limits.

- **Built a Rain Announcement App** 🌧️📢
  - **Functionality:** Created an app that sends announcements when it's raining in my area.
  - **Automation:** Connected the app to my [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) web service to run the code automatically every day.

- **Integrated Twilio for SMS Notifications** 📱✉️
  - **Virtual Number:** Explored Twilio and obtained a virtual number to send SMS notifications.
  - **Seamless Integration:** Implemented Twilio’s API to send automated rain alerts directly to my phone.

Feeling more confident and passionate about leveraging APIs to create meaningful and automated applications. Excited about what tomorrow holds! 🚀🐍

Stay tuned for more updates on this amazing journey! 🌟
