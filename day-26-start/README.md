Hey everyone! Today is **Day 26** of my Python journey, and it's been a productive day. Here's what I accomplished:

- **Mastered Comprehensions**
  - **List & Dictionary Comprehensions**: Learned how to write more concise and readable code using comprehensions.
  - **Map Game Enhancement**: Refactored my map game with comprehensions, resulting in cleaner and faster code.

- **Created Noto Alphabet Project**
  - **Project Setup**: Initialized the repository and organized the file structure.
  - **Unicode Exploration**: Began researching Unicode characters in the Noto font family.
  - **Initial Scripts**: Created scripts to parse and display various Noto characters.

Excited to apply these new skills in upcoming projects! 🚀🐍
