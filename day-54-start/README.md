### Day 54: Exploring Flask & Python Decorators 🖥️🐍

Today, I dipped my toes into **Flask** for basic web development. I learned how Flask routes work, how to return simple responses, and why **terminals** are so crucial in real-world development—they’re powerful tools for running, debugging, and deploying apps.

In the same session, I also revisited **Python decorators**. Decorators are super helpful for adding functionality (like timing a function’s runtime) without changing the function’s code, but they can be tricky to wrap your head around at first. Nonetheless, practice is helping me get more comfortable with them.

#### What I Covered:

1. **Flask Basics** 🌐
    - Setting up a simple app
    - Handling routes
    - Returning responses

2. **Terminals** 💻
    - Importance in real-world scenarios
    - Quick development tasks
    - Version control

3. **Python Decorators** 🧩
    - Measuring a function’s speed
    - Extending function behavior in a reusable way

I’m feeling excited and ready for the next steps in learning how to build more powerful web apps and master more advanced decorator use cases!

Stay tuned for more updates on my coding journey! 🚀✨
