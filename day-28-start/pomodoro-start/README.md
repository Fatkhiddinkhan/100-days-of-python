### Day 28: Building My First Fully Functional Pomodoro App 🕒🍅

Today was another excellent big step toward my dreams! From a young age, I've been fascinated by how apps run and how they're constructed—it has always impressed me a lot. Here's what I accomplished on **Day 28**:

- **GUI Development with Tkinter**: Learned the basics of creating graphical user interfaces using the **Tkinter** library.
- **Created a Pomodoro App**: Developed my very first fully functional app! 🚀
  - **Features**:
    - **Start and Stop Buttons**: Easily control your Pomodoro sessions.
    - **Repetition Logic**: Implements 4 work sessions, 4 short breaks, and a 20-minute long break after all reps.
- **First Functional App**: Proud to have built an app that works seamlessly with correct repetitions and timings.

I can't contain my passion for what's next on this journey. There's so much more to learn and create, and I'm excited to keep pushing forward until I achieve my goals! 🌟

Keep looking until I finish! 💪🐍
