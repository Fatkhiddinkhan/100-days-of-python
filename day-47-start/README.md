### Day 47: Developing an Amazon Price Tracker App & Enhancing OOP Skills 📦📉

Today marks **Day 47** of my **100 Days of Python** journey, and it was an extremely challenging yet rewarding practice day focused on web scraping and object-oriented programming (OOP).

- **Built an Amazon Price Tracker App** 🛒📧
  - **Functionality:**
    - **User Input:** Allows users to provide an Amazon product URL and their desired price.
    - **Price Monitoring:** Continuously monitors the product price.
    - **Automated Notifications:** Sends an email to the user when the product price drops below the desired amount.

- **Mastered Web Scraping Techniques** 🕸️🔍
  - **Beautiful Soup Mastery:** Continued to strengthen my web scraping abilities using the Beautiful Soup library for efficient data extraction and manipulation.
  - **Handling HTTP Headers:** Learned the importance of setting appropriate HTTP headers to mimic genuine user behavior and bypass Amazon's bot detection mechanisms.
  - **Challenges Faced:**
    - **Amazon Bot Detection:** Encountered difficulties accessing product data due to Amazon's advanced bot detection systems. Determined to research and implement solutions to overcome these challenges in future projects.

### Reflections & Takeaways

Developing the Amazon Price Tracker App not only saves time and money but also highlighted the significance of OOP in building efficient and scalable applications. Although I faced challenges with Amazon's bot detectors, this experience has motivated me to further enhance my web scraping techniques and OOP skills to tackle such issues effectively.

Feeling proud of today's accomplishments and excited to continue this journey toward becoming a Python master! 🚀🐍

Can't wait to see what **Day 48** brings! 🌟
