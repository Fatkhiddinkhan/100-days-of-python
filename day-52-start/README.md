### Day 52: A Long Day of Adapting Missions 🛠️🔍

I started **Day 52** with a mission to open Instagram, log in, find a target account, and follow some of its followers. However, Instagram’s bot detection proved to be quite strong—creating a fresh Instagram profile and instantly following a bunch of people is nearly impossible without getting flagged.

So, I switched the mission: instead of focusing on following, I focused on fetching a target account’s data (such as followers and following lists). This approach is much less risky and still helps me practice web automation skills.

#### About This Code

- **Purpose:**
  - This Python script logs into Instagram, navigates to a target profile, and scrapes its followers or followings. It saves the data in simple text files so you can keep track of who joined or left over time.

- **What It Does:**
  - **Logs into your Instagram account** (credentials required).
  - **Navigates to a specified user’s profile.**
  - **Fetches the list of followers or followings** (or both).
  - **Stores these lists in files** under an `info/` folder.
  - **Compares old vs. new lists** to identify new followers or those who have unfollowed.

- **Information Needed:**
  1. Your Instagram **username and password** for the bot to log in.
  2. The **`target_account`** username whose data you want to collect.

> **Note:** Make sure you have **Chrome** and **ChromeDriver** installed and properly set up on your system.

#### Final Note

I’m grateful for all I learned today. Even though it was a long day, I’m motivated to push forward and improve my coding skills. Next time, I’ll try to fix any “bags” in my code and refine my approach further!

Stay tuned for more updates. 🚀✨
