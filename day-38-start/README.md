### Day 38: Building an Exercise Tracker App & Embracing Independent Learning 💪📈

Today marks **Day 38** of my **100 Days of Python** journey, and it was another challenging yet rewarding day. Here's what I accomplished:

- **Created an Exercise Tracker App** 🏃‍♂️📊
  - **Functionality:** Developed an app to track daily exercises, including calories burned, duration, and distance.
  - **Nutritionix API Integration:** Connected the app with [Nutritionix's API](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api) to interpret user inputs and provide accurate exercise data.
  - **Sheety API Integration:** Utilized [Sheety](https://sheety.co/) to record daily progress, enabling seamless data storage and retrieval.

- **Embraced Independent Learning** 📚✨
  - **No Tutorial Videos:** Tackled today's projects without watching any tutorial videos, relying solely on API documentation, and available resources.
  - **Resource Discovery:** Discovered [Replit](https://replit.com/), a fantastic platform that allows me to work on my projects directly from my phone, making it easier to code on the go.

- **Overcame Challenges & Learned Resilience** 💪🧠
  - **API Authentication:** Gained a deeper understanding of API keys and their importance in securing and managing API access.
  - **Stress Management:** Faced a stressful day but pushed through the challenges, enhancing my problem-solving skills and resilience.

Feeling incredibly motivated and excited about the progress I’m making! Every day brings new challenges and opportunities to learn and create something amazing. Can't wait to see what **Day 39** holds! 🚀🐍

Stay tuned for more updates on this amazing journey! 🌟
