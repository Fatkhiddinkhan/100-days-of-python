### Day 55: Taking Flask & Decorators to the Next Level 🎯✨

Compared to **Day 54**, today was trickier because we dove deeper into **Flask** and **Python decorators**. On Day 54, we learned the basics of setting up routes in Flask and practiced decorator syntax. Today, we built on that knowledge by creating a fun number-guessing web game where the user guesses a random number (0–9). The server responds with whether the guess is too high, too low, or exactly right, showing a playful GIF each time.

#### What We Covered:

- **Python Decorators** 🧩
    - Gained more practice on how to extend a function’s behavior.
    - Used a decorator (`@higher_lower`) to check the user’s guess against the random number.

- **Flask Routing** 🌐
    - Dynamically handled routes like `/\<int:number\>` to accept user input and respond with different content.

- **Global Variables & State** 🔄
    - Implemented a `/new_game` route to reset the random number, allowing the user to start fresh whenever they want.

- **GIF Fun** 🎉
    - Added delightful GIFs for each outcome—**too high**, **too low**, and an **exact match**—to enhance user interaction.

#### In Short:

- **Day 54** was about the foundations of Flask and decorators.
- **Day 55** took those foundations and turned them into a fun, interactive web application—proof that practice with even simple examples helps you understand bigger concepts in Python web development!

I’m excited about the progress made today and look forward to pushing these skills further in the upcoming days.
